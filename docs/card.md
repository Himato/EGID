On the card chip, there are two private keys with corresponding public
keys on the [X.509-format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) certificates. The certificates are stored both on the chip:

1. certificate for electronic authentication and encryption;

2. certificate for providing a qualified electronic signature.

The certificates are valid until the date of expiry of the ID card, meaning up to five years depending on the validity of the physical ID card.
