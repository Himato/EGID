# EGID Project -- This project still under prototyping

We all know the benefit of technology, the power of it, and we in very fast world and every millisecond make a difference. Our goal is to change the national ID to an electronic ID-card, design a database, design a digital signature system, give the appropriate authorization to each governmental entity and built an efficient and secure ecosystem that saves time and money. Then just scan the electronic ID-card through the computer in the appropriate form. All data will be automatically filled out. Lets get things done faster, easier and cheaper!

## How?

- EID-card will provide electronic identity operates on the basis of a public key infrastructure (PKI). All operations (authentication, signing, and decryption) are PIN-protected (using PIN1, PIN2, PUK model).
- Digital Signature.
